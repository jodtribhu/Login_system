# Login_system
This is the repo for my article on my medium "Build a Login System in Node.js with Express,Passport.js and MySQL"(https://jodiss-tri.medium.com/build-a-login-system-in-node-js-using-passport-js-and-mysql-52667cf3cc40).
The objective of the article is to give you a clear understanding on how to setup a login system in Node.js with MySQL database.We will be using Express Framework’s EJS which would render the html pages.We will also be using Passport.js for authentication and Express-session for session management.The strategy we would be implementing in Passport.js would be the local strategy.
